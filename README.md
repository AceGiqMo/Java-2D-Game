The game is in development stage

In case of curiousity, you can type these commands in terminal for test:

```java
javac -d out src/main/*.java
javac -d out src/entities/*.java
cp -r src/res out;

java -cp out main.Main
```

Make sure that you are in the root folder of the project

IMPORTANT NOTE: It is highly recommended to install Java 23.0.1 (this version exactly) for the proper image display
